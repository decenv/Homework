circuits

with knowledge from the first 1/3 of phys 2 we should be able to build a magnet gun

electromotive force

Kirchoff's circuit rules
voltage rule (loop rule)
	the sum of changes in the potential (v) encountered in a complete trasversal of any loop of a circuit must be zero
	E-iR=0     i=E/R
Current rule (junction rule)
	the sum of all currents into a point in a circuit is equal to the sum of the currents leaving that point.
